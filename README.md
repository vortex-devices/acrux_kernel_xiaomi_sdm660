# Acrux kernel for MI 8 Lite (sdm660) source

## Branches and informaton
```
Currently, you're on the stable repository. My staging repository can be found on my personal GitHub.

pie: Current stable branch, if you're building inline on ROMs COMPILE DIS (obviously for 9.0 Pie) - EAS > HMP
hmp: (what was) A hmp kernel which tbh is quite old and depriciated, as EAS best now

From the creation of this README, all releases will be tagged and will have release candidates + full releases under Pie.
I'm planning to add CI/CD support soon but cba to setup Drone.

## Features you will never see
```
- Overclocking (not possible on a HW level on the SDM660)
- Any governors other than schedutil (they're fucking useless man)
- No other I/O schedulers (maybe Anxiety)
- Nothing that comprimises performance - I prefer performance > battery because I'm near an outlet
- Constant upstreaming - when I can be bothered, I'll upstream
```
